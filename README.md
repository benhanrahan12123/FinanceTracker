## Usage

Requirements: NodeJS

To use this application, clone the production branch, this is done by passing the -b flag when cloning, "git clone -b production --single-branch https://github.com/username/repo.git"
"

From here, navigate to the frontend folder, open a terminal inside this directory and run npm install.
Do this exact same procedure for the backend also.

Once this has been done, enter your MongoDB URL in the .env file located in the root of the backend folder.

You can then launch the application, by running an instance of 'npm start' in both the frontend and backend folder, respectively.
